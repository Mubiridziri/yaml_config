# Symfony Yaml Config Bundle
> Symfony Bundle for storing application config in YAML file

If your application has system settings that must be changed both through the API and through the system administrator, then this extension is for you!
When the settings are not needed so often, why store them in the database? Inspired by Symfony architectural approach to storing gang configuration, I developed a package that will allow you to store application system settings in this way!

## Installation

```
$ composer require <package_name>
```
